# A GUI TingoDB/MongoDB manager for building back-end web applications

## Objective:
There is no GUI database management system built yet for any Embedded MongoDB database. 

This project aims to fulfill that gap and make web development easier for beginners without having to install MongoDB and set up its path and all.

This is to be used as the **de-facto** by all developers using MongoDB/Mongoose as database and using TingoDB for modeling purposes. 

## Goals:

1. To make a **single** electron app similar to RoboT which takes care of the database of only the current project and runs its own server.

2. To make it easy to create, read, edit and delete parts of the database simply with mouse.
3. Enable querying interface.


## Instructions for use:

Make sure you have **Node** and **Git** installed. Then follow these instructions below:

1. First run `git clone https://github.com/Himujjal/tingo-db-gui-manager`
2. Then run `cd ./server && npm install && npm run dev`
3. Open another terminal in the root folder and run the React App using: `cd ./client && npm install && npm run start`

Feel Free to contribute to this project!
